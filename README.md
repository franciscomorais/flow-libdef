Utility to install a flow dependency that tries to install the lib dependency but if it doesn't find it, will create a stub.

## Dependencies

- node 8.x
- yarn
- flow-typed

## Installation guide

```
npm i -g flow-libdef
```

## Why

Imagine that you have a `lodash` dependency on your project you never installed the libdef flow of this dependency. To install these libdef dependency, before, you needed to know what version that you have installed on your project, after that you will be try to install the libdef running the `flow-typed install lodash@4.0.0` command as an example, and if the library don 't have a compatible libdef, you need to create the library stub.

## How to use

This utility helps to install a dependency using only the name of library. You just need run this command:

```
flow-libdef install lodash
```

and, voil√°, the libdef dependecy will be installed or the stub will be created.

I hope this helps you in this process.
